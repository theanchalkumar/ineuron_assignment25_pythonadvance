Q1. What is the distinction between a numpy array and a pandas data frame? Is there a way to convert between the two if there is?

# Ans : Numpy array: This is in the form of matrix structure which have rows and columns. It generally performs python 
#       mathematical operation which is not genrally easy manually to perfomr in coding case. It may be of any 
#       dimensions like 1-d, 2-d, 3-d, 4-d, etc depend upon the use to requirement. Unlike dataframe, numpy array are 
#       not in a tabular form which ahve records and have fields instead it is in the form of matrices. It can have
#       single row and single column as well but dataframe poses more than one column
#       DataFrame: This is a kind of tabular structure format which are having more than one column. Unlike numpy 
#       array which can have more single as well as many number of columns, but dataframe have more than one column.
#       Dataframe can have any number of dimensons but it should be more than one. We can use numpy array operation 
#       in dataframe and can also convert the numpy array into dataframe.
#       We can convert between the two in following manner:
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
array=np.arange(10).reshape(2,5)
array


     
array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
       [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]])

df=pd.DataFrame(array)
df


     
0	1	2	3	4
0	0	1	2	3	4
1	5	6	7	8	9

df.to_numpy()


     
array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
       [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]])
Q2. What can go wrong when an user enters in a stock-ticker symbol, and how do you handle it?

# Ans : 


     
Q3. Identify some of the plotting techniques that are used to produce a stock-market chart.

# Ans : LINE CHART.POINT AND FIGURE CHART, CANDLESTICK CHART, BAR CHART.


     
Q4. Why is it essential to print a legend on a stock market chart?

# Ans : Legends adds a beauty to visualize the trend of data w.r.t. different features. It creates the different 
#       trend in different colors indicating that which is belong to which trend is belong to which feature.


     
Q5. What is the best way to limit the length of a pandas data frame to less than a year?

# Ans : We can use start and end parameters for that. In start we write the date from where we are starting and at 
#       the end we write the end date. SO within this span we can restric the duration. Also we can use the parameters 
#       like periods for how much times we need the duration and we can also use the frequency parameter.


     
Q6. What is the definition of a 180-day moving average?

# Ans : Moving Averages help to filter out market noise and smooth out fluctuations in price. In statistics, a moving
#       average is a calculation used to analyze data points by creating a series of averages of different subsets of 
#       the full data set. 180-day moving average means A simple moving average (SMA) is a arithmetic mean of a given 
#       set of prices over the 180 days in the past
